# Twitter NER Investigation

## Context
This project began in July 2022 and ended in February 2023 as an "initiation to investigation" activity at Universidad Cat√≥lica del Uruguay, when I was finishing my first semester at the university. I took on this challenge to push myself, which led me to learn and explore many new technologies. I will always be grateful to Bernardo Rychtenberg, the professor who guided me, for this great opportunity and for being such a supportive mentor.

To be uploaded to GitHub, I did some minor refactoring. However, the vast majority of the code is exactly the same as it was. Expect some monstrosities, as I wanted to preserve it as a milestone in my learning journey that I will always hold dear.

## Poster

This investigation resulted in a poster, where it summarizes what was the intention of the investigation, the development and results. You can see it [here](https://github.com/ManuelM512/twitter-ner-investigation/blob/main/investigation_poster.pdf) (keep in mind, it's in spanish)

## Project Description

This project focuses on applying Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques to analyze tweets and determine the locations mentioned at the time of the tweet. The tweets were previously extracted with the use of the twitter api, using setted trends as filters to catch streams of tweets. The goal is to accurately extract and identify geographical locations from tweet texts, enabling better understanding and analysis of location-based trends and insights from social media data.

## Features
- Extraction of location entities from tweet texts.
- Analysis and visualization of location-based trends.
- Robust handling of noisy and unstructured tweet data.

## What I Learned
- How to use Pandas
- How to utilize a BERT model
- An understanding of Hugging Face's models
- A basic understanding of Transformers and how they work
- Data normalization techniques
